    *   `README.md`: Project description and instructions.
    *   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
    *   `.cursor/instructions/`: Project specific Cursor AI instructions.

### 1.2. File Naming Conventions:

*   Python files: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `user_handlers.py`, `database_utils.py`).
*   Class names: `CamelCase` (e.g., `UserHandler`, `DatabaseConnection`).
*   Function names: `snake_case` (e.g., `get_user`, `create_product`).
*   Variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `user_id`, `product_name`).
*   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_PORT`, `MAX_CONNECTIONS`).

### 1.3. Module Organization:

*   Group related functionality into modules.
*   Use clear and descriptive module names.
*   Avoid circular dependencies.
*   Keep modules focused and concise.
*   Use packages to organize modules into a hierarchical structure.

### 1.4. Component Architecture:

*   **Layered Architecture:** Separate the application into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
*   **Microservices Architecture:** Decompose the application into small, independent services.
*   **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** Decouple the application core from external dependencies.
*   **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** Organize the application into models (data), views (presentation), and controllers (logic).

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies:

*   **Route-based splitting:** Load modules based on the requested route.
*   **Feature-based splitting:** Divide the application into feature modules.
*   **Component-based splitting:** Split the application into reusable components.
*   **On-demand loading:** Load modules only when they are needed.
*   **Asynchronous loading:** Use `asyncio.gather` or similar techniques to load modules concurrently.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

*   **Factory:** For creating instances of classes with complex initialization logic.
*   **Strategy:** For implementing different algorithms or behaviors.
*   **Observer:** For implementing event-driven systems.
*   **Middleware:** For handling cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and error handling.

### 2.2. Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks:

*   **Request Handling:** Use request handlers to process incoming requests.
*   **Routing:** Use `aiohttp.web.RouteTableDef` for defining routes.

*   **Blocking operations in asynchronous code:** Avoid using blocking operations (e.g., `time.sleep`) in asynchronous code.
*   **Ignoring exceptions:** Always handle exceptions properly to prevent unexpected behavior.
*   **Overusing global variables:** Avoid using global variables as much as possible to maintain code clarity and testability.
*   **Tight coupling:** Decouple components to improve maintainability and reusability.
*   **Hardcoding configuration:** Use environment variables or configuration files to manage configuration settings.

### 2.4. State Management:

*   **Application State:** Store application-level state in the `aiohttp.web.Application` instance.
*   **Request State:** Store request-specific state in the `aiohttp.web.Request` instance.

*   **Linting Tool:** Use a linting tool like pylint or flake8 to enforce code style.
*   **Formatting Tool:** Use a formatting tool like black or autopep8 to format code automatically.

### 7.2. Build Configuration:

*   **Use a build system:** Use a build system like Make or tox to automate build tasks.
*   **Define dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`:** Specify all project dependencies in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file.
*   **Use a Dockerfile:** Use a Dockerfile to create a containerized build environment.

*   **Configure linting tools:** Configure linting tools to enforce code style instructions.
*   **Configure formatting tools:** Configure formatting tools to format code automatically.
*   **Use pre-commit hooks:** Use pre-commit hooks to run linters and formatters before committing code.

### 7.4. Deployment:

*   **Use a web server:** Use a web server like Nginx or Apache to serve the application.
*   **Use a process manager:** Use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to manage the application process.
*   **Use a reverse proxy:** Use a reverse proxy to improve security and performance.
*   **Use a load balancer:** Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
*   **Use a monitoring system:** Use a monitoring system to track application health and performance.

*   **Nginx + Supervisord:** Nginx prevents attacks, allows utilizing all CPU cores, and serves static files faster.
*   **Nginx + Gunicorn:** Gunicorn launches the app as worker processes, simplifying deployment compared to bare Nginx.

### 7.5. CI/CD Integration:

*   **Automate deployment:** Automate deployment to reduce manual effort and improve consistency.

## Additional Best Practices:

*   **Session Management:** Always create a `ClientSession` for making requests and reuse it across multiple requests to benefit from connection pooling. Avoid creating a new session for each request, as this can lead to performance issues.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your request handlers. Use try-except blocks to manage exceptions, particularly for network-related errors. For example, handle `ConnectionResetError` to manage client disconnections gracefully.
*   **Middleware Usage:** Utilize middleware for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, and modifying requests/responses. Define middleware functions that accept a request and a handler, allowing you to process requests before they reach your main handler.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Implement graceful shutdown procedures for your server to ensure that ongoing requests are completed before the application exits. This can be achieved by registering shutdown signals and cleaning up resources.
*   **Security Practices:** When deploying, consider using a reverse proxy like Nginx for added security and performance. Configure SSL/TLS correctly to secure your application.
*   **Character Set Detection:**  If a response does not include the charset needed to decode the body, use `ClientSession` accepts a `fallback_charset_resolver` parameter which can be used to introduce charset guessing functionality.
*   **Persistent Session:** Use `Cleanup Context` when creating a persistent session.

By adhering to these practices, developers can enhance the reliability, performance, and security of their `aiohttp` applications.
