# AWS Development Best Practices using Terraform

This document outlines best practices for developing and maintaining AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Following these guidelines will help ensure your code is maintainable, secure, and efficient.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1 Directory Structure

-   **Root Module**: The primary entry point for your infrastructure definition. Contains `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `providers.tf`, `versions.tf` and `locals.tf`.
-   **Modules Directory**:  Reusable components of your infrastructure. Each module should have its own directory under `modules/`.
-   **Examples Directory**: Demonstrates how to use the modules. Each example should be a self-contained Terraform configuration.
-   **Scripts Directory**: Custom scripts used by Terraform.
-   **Templates Directory**:  Templates for files that are read using the `templatefile` function, using the extension `.tftpl`.
-   **Files Directory**: Contains static files referenced by Terraform (e.g., startup scripts).
-   **Helpers Directory**:  Contains utility scripts that are *not* directly called by Terraform.
-   **.tfvars files**: Files containing variable definitions.  Use `terraform.tfvars` for common values and create environment specific files in the `envs/` directory (e.g., `envs/dev/terraform.tfvars`, `envs/prod/terraform.tfvars`).
-   **.gitignore**:  Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
-   **docs/**: Place any supplemental documentation in a `docs/` subdirectory.
-   **CODEOWNERS**:  File to document who is responsible for the module. Before any merge request is merged, an owner should approve it.

Example:

│   │   ├── terraform.tfvars
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── providers.tf
├── versions.tf
├── locals.tf
└── .gitignore


### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

-   `main.tf`: Primary entry point for resource definitions.
-   `variables.tf`:  Variable declarations.
-   `outputs.tf`: Output declarations.
-   `providers.tf`:  Provider configuration.
-   `versions.tf`:  Terraform and provider version constraints.
-   `locals.tf`: Local variable definitions.
-   `*.tfvars`: Variable value files. Use `terraform.tfvars` for default values and `env/<environment>.tfvars` for environment-specific values.

### 1.3 Module Organization

-   **Reusable Modules**: Create modules for common infrastructure components (e.g., EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPCs).
-   **Module Composition**:  Compose complex infrastructure by combining smaller, reusable modules.
-   **Module Versioning**: Use version control (e.g., Git tags) to manage module versions.
-   **Module Naming**: Module repositories must use the format `terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>`.  For example: `terraform-aws-ec2`
-   **Module sources**: When referencing another module on a public registry, pin the Git commit hash by pointing directly to the underlying Git repo URL. Example:

    terraform
    module "lambda" {
        source = "github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda.git?ref=e78cdf1f82944897ca6e30d6489f43cf24539374" # --> v4.18.0
    }
    

### 1.4 Component Architecture

-   **Layered Architecture**: Separate infrastructure into logical layers (e.g., network, compute, data).
-   **Loose Coupling**: Design components to be loosely coupled, minimizing dependencies between them.
-   **Clear Abstractions**: Use modules to create clear abstractions for complex infrastructure components.

### 1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

-   **Functional Decomposition**: Split code into smaller, manageable functions.
-   **Resource Grouping**: Group related resources into separate files or modules.
-   **Environment Separation**: Use separate files or modules for environment-specific configurations.
-   **Service-Based Separation**: Separate resources by service (e.g., `iam.tf`, `ec2.tf`, `s3.tf`) only if they exceed 150 lines in `main.tf`.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1 Design Patterns Specific to AWS

-   **Immutable Infrastructure**:  Deploy new infrastructure components instead of modifying existing ones.
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage infrastructure through code, using tools like Terraform.
-   **Blue/Green Deployments**:  Deploy new versions of applications alongside existing ones, then switch traffic.
-   **Canary Deployments**:  Deploy new versions of applications to a small subset of users before rolling them out to everyone.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

-   **Creating VPCs**: Use the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module for creating VPCs.
-   **Creating EC2 Instances**: Use the `terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws` module for creating EC2 instances.
-   **Creating S3 Buckets**: Use the `terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws` module for creating S3 buckets.
-   **Managing IAM Roles**: Use the `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_policy` resources to manage IAM roles and policies.
-   **Using Data Sources**: Utilize data sources (e.g., `aws_ami`, `aws_vpc`) to fetch information about existing AWS resources.
-   **Resource Tagging**:  Tag all AWS resources for cost allocation, automation, and identification.
-   **State File Storage**: Use a remote backend (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking) for storing Terraform state.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells to Avoid

-   **Hardcoding Values**:  Avoid hardcoding values in your code. Use variables instead.
-   **Storing Secrets in Code**:  Never store secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) in your code. Use AWS Secrets Manager or other secret management solutions.
-   **Overly Complex Modules**:  Avoid creating modules that are too complex and difficult to understand.
-   **Ignoring Errors**: Always handle errors gracefully.
-   **Manual Infrastructure Changes**: Avoid making manual changes to infrastructure outside of Terraform.
-   **Using embedded resource attributes**: avoid using these embedded resource attributes and instead you should use the unique resource to attach that pseudo-resource. These resource relationships can cause chicken/egg issues that are unique per resource.

### 2.4 State Management Best Practices

-   **Remote Backend**:  Use a remote backend (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking) for storing Terraform state. This allows for collaboration and prevents data loss.
-   **State Locking**:  Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications to the state file.
-   **State Encryption**:  Encrypt the state file at rest and in transit.
-   **Workspace Management**:  Use Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
-   **Secure State Access**: Restrict access to the state file to authorized users and systems only. Consider implementing least privilege principles.
-   **Versioning**: Implement a mechanism for versioning your state files, which could include frequent backups and using version control systems.
-   **Avoid local state**: Never store Terraform state locally.

### 2.5 Error Handling Patterns

-   **Validation instructions**: Use validation instructions within variable definitions to check input values.
-   **Error Propagation**:  Propagate errors up the call stack to be handled at a higher level.
-   **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network errors, API throttling).
-   **Logging**:  Log errors and warnings to aid in debugging.
-   **Custom Error Messages**: Provide clear and informative error messages to users.
-   **Panic Handling**: Avoid using `panic()` function that stops the execution, implement error handling.
