## 1. Code Organization and Structure

### 1.1. Directory Structure Best Practices

- **Application-Centric Structure:** Organize your Django project around applications (apps), where each app represents a specific feature or module.
- **Dedicated 'models' Module:** Keep all model definitions within the `models.py` file of each app.
- **Separate Queries:** For complex queries, consider creating a `queries.py` or `managers.py` file within your app to house custom querysets and managers.
- **Consistent Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for app and model names.


myproject/
 ├── myproject/
 │   ├── __init__.py
 │   ├── asgi.py
 │   ├── settings.py
 │   ├── urls.py
 │   ├── wsgi.py
 ├── app1/
 │   ├── __init__.py
 │   ├── admin.py
 │   ├── apps.py
 │   ├── models.py
 │   ├── managers.py  # Custom managers and querysets
 │   ├── views.py
 │   ├── urls.py
 │   ├── forms.py
 │   ├── tests.py
 │   └── migrations/
 ├── app2/
 │   └── ...
 └── manage.py


### 1.2. File Naming Conventions

- **Models:** Use singular nouns and CamelCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `BlogPost`).
- **Fields:** Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case, e.g., `first_name`, `date_joined`).
- **Managers/Querysets:** Use descriptive names related to their functionality (e.g., `ActiveUsersManager`, `PublishedPostsQuerySet`).
- **Files:** Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case, e.g., `models.py`, `forms.py`, `urls.py`).

### 1.3. Module Organization

- **Keep Models Concise:** Limit the number of models in each app to a manageable amount (ideally under 10). If an app becomes too large, refactor it into smaller, more focused apps.
- **Avoid Circular Imports:** Be mindful of circular dependencies between models and other modules within the same app or across apps.  Use string references in `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` definitions to avoid immediate import requirements.
- **Utilize Abstract Base Classes:** For common fields across multiple models, define an abstract base class and inherit from it. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy. Don't forget to set `abstract = True` in the `Meta` class.
- **Consider Proxy Models:** Use proxy models (`proxy = True` in `Meta`) to change a model's behavior without altering the database schema. This is useful for adding methods or changing the default ordering.

### 1.4. Component Architecture

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Create reusable components such as custom model fields, managers, and querysets.  
- **Model Mixins:** Use model mixins to add common functionality to multiple models (e.g., a mixin for soft deletion or timestamping).
- **Form Abstraction:** Create reusable form classes and widgets for data input and validation.
- **Template Tags and Filters:** Develop custom template tags and filters to simplify common tasks in templates related to model data.

### 1.5. Code Splitting Strategies

- **App-Based Splitting:** Organize models and related code within distinct Django apps.
- **Manager-Based Splitting:** Divide complex queries into custom managers and querysets.
- **Mixin-Based Splitting:** Utilize mixins to compartmentalize functionality across models.
- **Signal-Based Splitting:** Implement signals for decoupling operations, such as triggering tasks when a model is saved or deleted.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1. Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic behind a repository interface, allowing you to switch between different data sources without modifying the rest of your application.
- **Unit of Work Pattern:** Group multiple database operations into a single transaction to ensure atomicity and consistency.
- **Specification Pattern:** Encapsulate query logic into reusable specification objects, allowing you to combine and reuse queries across different parts of your application.
- **Model Decorators:** Use decorators to add functionality to models without modifying the original model class. Useful for things like caching calculated properties.

### 2.2. Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

- **Filtering Data:** Use `filter()` and `exclude()` for efficient data retrieval.
- **Ordering Data:** Utilize `order_by()` to specify the order of results.
- **Aggregating Data:** Employ `aggregate()` to calculate summary statistics.
- **Creating and Updating Objects:** Use `create()` and `save()` for object manipulation.
- **Deleting Objects:** Use `delete()` for removing objects.
- **Prefetch Related:** Use `select_related` for ForeignKey and OneToOneField relationships, and `prefetch_related` for ManyToManyField and reverse ForeignKey relationships.

### 2.3. Anti-patterns and Code Smells

- **Overusing `raw()` Queries:** Prefer Django ORM methods over raw SQL queries to maintain database abstraction and security.
- **Ignoring Database Indexes:** Neglecting to add indexes to frequently queried columns can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. Use `db_index = True` and `Index` in Meta to specify indices.
- **Using `null=True` for String-Based Fields:** Avoid `null=True` for `CharField` and `TextField` fields. Use `blank=True` and an empty string (`''`) instead.
- **Creating Large Querysets without Pagination:** Avoid retrieving large datasets without pagination. Use Django's `Paginator` to break results into manageable chunks.
- **Performing Logic in Templates:** Keep templates focused on presentation. Move complex logic to views or custom template tags.
- **N+1 Query Problem:** Accessing related objects in a loop can cause the N+1 query problem. Use `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to mitigate this.
- **Inefficient Use of Exists/Count:** Prefer `exists()` over `count()` when simply checking for the existence of objects.
- **Unnecessary Database Hits:** Optimize data access patterns to minimize the number of database queries.

### 2.4. State Management

- **Database as Primary State:** Rely on the database as the single source of truth for application state.
- **Session Management:** Utilize Django's session framework for storing user-specific state.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Avoid Global Mutable State:**  Minimize the use of global mutable state, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and concurrency issues.

### 2.5. Error Handling

- **Catch Database Exceptions:** Handle database exceptions (e.g., `IntegrityError`, `OperationalError`) gracefully.
- **Use Transactions:** Wrap multiple database operations in a transaction to ensure atomicity.
- **Log Errors:** Log errors and exceptions for debugging and monitoring purposes.  Use `logger.exception()` to capture the traceback.
- **Custom Exception Handling Middleware:** Consider writing custom middleware to catch and handle database errors at a global level, providing user-friendly error messages.
- **Validate Data Before Saving:** Always validate data before saving it to the database to prevent errors and data inconsistencies. Use Django's built-in validators or create custom validators.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1. Optimization Techniques

- **Query Optimization:** Use `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to reduce the number of database queries.
- **Indexing:** Add indexes to frequently queried columns.
- **Caching:** Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
- **Pagination:** Use pagination for large datasets.
- **Batch Operations:** Use `bulk_create`, `bulk_update` and `bulk_delete` for bulk operations.
- **Defer/Only:** use `defer` to exclude fields from the query or `only` to only include specific fields in the query.
- **Conditional Expressions:** Use `Case`, `When`, and `Value` within queries to perform conditional logic directly in the database.

### 3.2. Memory Management

- **Limit Queryset Size:** Avoid retrieving large datasets into memory. Use pagination or generators.
- **Use Generators:** For processing large datasets, use generators to process data in chunks.
- **Garbage Collection:** Understand Python's garbage collection mechanisms and how they affect memory usage.
- **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

### 3.3. Rendering Optimization

- **Template Caching:** Cache frequently used templates to reduce rendering time.
- **Context Processors:** Minimize the data passed to templates via context processors.
- **Lazy Loading:** Use lazy loading for images and other resources to improve initial page load time.  Consider using template tags like `{% static %}` and `{% get_static_prefix %}` effectively.

### 3.4. Bundle Size Optimization

- **Remove Unused Code:** Eliminate unused models, fields, and queries.
- **Optimize Static Files:** Minify and compress static files (CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **Code Splitting:**  Split JavaScript and CSS into smaller chunks for efficient loading.

### 3.5. Lazy Loading

- **Load Related Data on Demand:** Use lazy loading for related data to improve initial performance. Consider using Django Rest Framework serializers with `depth=0` and selectively increasing the depth when needed.
- **Database Views:** Create database views for complex queries to improve performance.
- **QuerySet Iterators:** Instead of converting large querysets into lists, iterate over them using `.iterator()` for memory efficiency.
