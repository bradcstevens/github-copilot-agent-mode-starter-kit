- # Code Organization and Structure
  - Effective code organization is critical for maintainability and scalability in Microsoft Teams application development.

  - ## Directory Structure Best Practices
    - **src/**: Contains all source code.
      - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
      - **modules/**: Independent, reusable modules with specific functionalities (e.g., authentication, data fetching).
      - **pages/** or **views/**: Top-level components representing different application views/pages.
      - **services/**: Code interacting with Microsoft Teams APIs or other external services.
      - **utils/** or **helpers/**: Utility functions, constants, and helper classes.
      - **styles/**: CSS, SCSS, or other styling-related files.
      - **types/**: TypeScript type definitions (if using TypeScript).
    - **public/**: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.).
    - **tests/**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    - **.cursor/**: Stores Cursor-specific project instructions.

  - ## File Naming Conventions
    - **Components:** PascalCase (e.g., `MyTeamsComponent.tsx`).
    - **Modules:** camelCase (e.g., `teamsAuthentication.ts`).
    - **Styles:** kebab-case (e.g., `my-teams-component.scss`).
    - **Tests:** `<filename>.test.ts` or `<filename>.spec.ts` (e.g., `MyTeamsComponent.test.tsx`).
    - **Interfaces/Types:** Capitalized with a leading `I` if an interface (e.g., `IUser.ts`).

  - ## Module Organization
    - Favor small, focused modules with clear responsibilities.
    - Use dependency injection to manage dependencies between modules.
    - Consider using an inversion of control (IoC) container for more complex applications.

  - ## Component Architecture
    - **Presentational Components:** Responsible for rendering UI; receive data and callbacks as props.
    - **Container Components:** Fetch data, manage state, and pass data to presentational components.
    - Consider using a state management library like Redux, Zustand, or Jotai for complex applications.

  - ## Code Splitting
    - Use dynamic imports to lazy-load modules and components.
    - Implement route-based code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size.
    - Analyze bundle size using tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify large dependencies.

- # Common Patterns and Anti-patterns
  - Employing established design patterns and avoiding anti-patterns are crucial for writing clean, maintainable code in Microsoft Teams development.

  - ## Design Patterns
    - **Observer Pattern:** Useful for subscribing components to changes in Teams state (e.g., user presence, channel messages).
    - **Factory Pattern:** Abstract component creation to simplify management of different Teams context variables or user settings.
    - **Strategy Pattern:** To handle different API authentication approaches and use appropriate logic depending on where code is run (webpage or Teams client)
    - **Facade Pattern:** Simplify complex Teams API interactions by providing a higher-level interface.

  - ## Recommended Approaches
    - Use the Microsoft Teams Client SDK for interacting with the Teams client.
    - Prefer asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the UI thread.
    - Implement proper error handling for API calls and user input.
    - Adopt responsive design principles to ensure your application works well on different screen sizes.

  - ## Anti-patterns and Code Smells
    - **Deeply Nested Components:** Leads to performance issues and difficulty in understanding the component hierarchy.
    - **God Objects:** Modules or components with too many responsibilities.
    - **Copy-Pasted Code:** Indicates a lack of proper abstraction and code reuse.
    - **Ignoring Errors:** Can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.
    - **Over-reliance on `any` Type (TypeScript):** Reduces the benefits of TypeScript's type safety.

  - ## State Management
    - For simple components, use React's built-in `useState` hook.
    - For complex applications, consider using a state management library:
      - **Redux:** Predictable state container with a centralized store and unidirectional data flow.
      - **Zustand:** Small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.
      - **Jotai:** Primitive and flexible state management with an atomic model.
    - Avoid mutating state directly; use immutability techniques.

  - ## Error Handling
    - Use `try...catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
    - Implement global error handling to catch unhandled exceptions.
    - Log errors to a central location for monitoring and debugging.
    - Provide informative error messages to the user.

- # Performance Considerations
  - Optimizing performance is crucial for providing a smooth user experience in Microsoft Teams applications.

  - ## Optimization Techniques
    - **Memoization:** Cache the results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations.
    - **Debouncing and Throttling:** Limit the rate at which functions are executed in response to user input.
    - **Virtualization:** Render only the visible portion of large lists or tables.
    - **Code Splitting:** As mentioned earlier, divide code into smaller chunks to reduce initial load time.
    - **Efficient Data Structures:** Use appropriate data structures for optimal performance (e.g., Maps instead of Objects for frequent lookups).

  - ## Memory Management
    - Avoid memory leaks by properly cleaning up resources (e.g., event listeners, timers).
    - Use weak references when necessary to avoid preventing garbage collection.
    - Monitor memory usage using browser developer tools to identify potential issues.

  - ## Rendering Optimization
    - Use React.memo or similar techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    - Optimize images and other assets to reduce file size.
    - Minimize DOM manipulations.

  - ## Bundle Size Optimization
    - Use tree shaking to remove unused code from dependencies.
    - Minify and compress code using tools like Terser and Gzip.
    - Analyze bundle size to identify large dependencies and consider alternatives.

  - ## Lazy Loading
    - Lazy-load images and other assets that are not immediately visible.
    - Use Intersection Observer API to detect when elements are visible.
    - Lazy load modules by incorporating `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.

- # Security Best Practices
  - Security is paramount when developing Microsoft Teams applications to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.

  - ## Common Vulnerabilities
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into the application.
    - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attacking users into performing actions without their consent.
    - **Authentication and Authorization Flaws:** Improperly securing user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - **Data Injection:** SQL injection, LDAP injection, etc.

  - ## Prevention Strategies
    - **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.
    - **Output Encoding:** Escape output to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP to restrict the sources of content that the browser is allowed to load.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

  - ## Authentication and Authorization
    - Use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization.
    - Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
    - Store credentials securely using appropriate encryption and hashing techniques.

  - ## Data Protection
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Implement data loss prevention (DLP) policies to prevent sensitive information from being shared inappropriately.
    - Follow privacy best practices to protect user data.

  - ## Secure API Communication
    - Use HTTPS for all API communication.
    - Validate server-side certificate.
    - Implement proper authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
    - Use rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

- # Testing Approaches
  - Comprehensive testing is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of Microsoft Teams applications.

  - ## Unit Testing
    - Test individual components and modules in isolation.
    - Use mocking and stubbing to isolate dependencies.
    - Aim for high code coverage to ensure that all parts of the code are tested.

  - ## Integration Testing
    - Test the interaction between different components and modules.
    - Verify that data flows correctly between different parts of the application.
    - Test integrations with Microsoft Teams APIs and other external services.

  - ## End-to-End Testing
    - Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
    - Simulate real-world user scenarios.
    - Use tools like Cypress or Playwright to automate end-to-end tests.

  - ## Test Organization
    - Organize tests into logical groups based on functionality or component.
    - Use clear and descriptive test names.
    - Keep tests small and focused.

  - ## Mocking and Stubbing
    - Use mocking libraries like Jest or Sinon.js to create mocks and stubs.
    - Mock external dependencies to isolate the code under test.
    - Use stubs to provide controlled responses from dependencies.
