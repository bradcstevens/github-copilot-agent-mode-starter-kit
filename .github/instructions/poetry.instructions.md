# Poetry Python Library Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for utilizing Poetry, a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. Following these guidelines will result in more maintainable, scalable, and robust Python projects.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

A well-organized project structure is critical for maintainability and collaboration. Poetry provides the tools to enforce a standardized structure.

### 1.1 Directory Structure Best Practices

*   **Root Directory:** The root directory contains the `pyproject.toml` file, `README.md`, and potentially other top-level configuration files (e.g., `.gitignore`, `mypy.ini`).
*   **Source Directory:** The main source code should reside in a dedicated directory. The typical layout is to place your package in a top-level directory, e.g., `my_package/`, or within a `src/` directory (e.g., `src/my_package/`). Using `src/` allows for cleaner separation of concerns, facilitating testing and package building.
    *   **Choosing Between Flat and `src` Layouts:**
        *   **Flat Layout (default):** `my_project/my_package/__init__.py`
        *   **`src` Layout:** `my_project/src/my_package/__init__.py`. The `src` layout avoids potential import ambiguity when running scripts from the project root and provides a clearer separation between project-level files and package code.
*   **Tests Directory:** Tests should be in a `tests/` directory, mirroring the source structure. This helps in easily locating and running tests. Include an `__init__.py` in the directory to make it a package.
*   **Docs Directory (Optional):** If the project requires extensive documentation, a `docs/` directory can be included to house documentation files.
*   **Examples Directory (Optional):** Provides example usage scenarios to help end-users easily start using your library.

Example directory structure (using the `src` layout):

```
my_project/
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── module1.py
│       └── module2.py
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── test_module1.py
│   └── test_module2.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── poetry.lock
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

*   **Python Files:** Use lowercase names with underscores (snake_case) for Python files (e.g., `my_module.py`, `data_processing.py`).
*   **Test Files:**  Test files should mirror the module being tested, prefixed with `test_`.  For example, `test_my_module.py` tests `my_module.py`.
*   **`__init__.py`:**  Use an empty `__init__.py` file or add initialization logic if needed. The presence of `__init__.py` makes the directory a Python package.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Use descriptive names for configuration files (e.g., `config.py`, `settings.toml`).

### 1.3 Module Organization

*   **Grouping Functionality:** Group related functions and classes into modules. Each module should represent a specific functionality or component.
*   **Avoiding Circular Dependencies:**  Design modules to minimize dependencies on each other. Circular dependencies can lead to import errors and make code harder to understand.
*   **Explicit Imports:** Use explicit imports (e.g., `from my_package.module1 import function_x`) instead of wildcard imports (`from my_package.module1 import *`). Explicit imports improve code readability and reduce namespace pollution.
*   **Relative Imports (Where Appropriate):** Within a package, use relative imports (e.g., `from . import module2` or `from .. import another_package`) to reference other modules in the same package. This makes the package more self-contained.

### 1.4 Component Architecture

*   **Layered Architecture:** For larger projects, consider a layered architecture (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer). This promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase more modular.
*   **Microservices (If Applicable):** If the project is complex, consider splitting it into microservices, each managed as a separate Poetry project.
*   **Dependency Injection:**  Employ dependency injection to decouple components.  This enhances testability and flexibility.
*   **Interfaces:** Define clear interfaces between components. This allows for easier swapping of implementations without affecting other parts of the system.

### 1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

*   **By Functionality:** Split code into modules based on functionality (e.g., `data_processing.py`, `api_client.py`, `ui_components.py`).
*   **By Component:**  If using a component-based architecture, split code into modules representing individual components.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Use lazy loading for modules that are not immediately required at startup. This can improve application startup time.
*   **Dynamic Imports:** Use dynamic imports (e.g., `importlib.import_module`) for optional dependencies or features. Handle potential `ImportError` exceptions gracefully.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

Understanding common patterns and anti-patterns is essential for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

### 2.1 Design Patterns

*   **Factory Pattern:** Use factory patterns to create objects without specifying their concrete classes. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to switch between different implementations.
*   **Strategy Pattern:** Use strategy patterns to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable at runtime. This allows for flexible algorithm selection based on different conditions.
*   **Observer Pattern:**  Implement the observer pattern for event handling and decoupled communication between components.
*   **Singleton Pattern (Use Sparingly):** Avoid overuse of the singleton pattern.  If used, ensure thread safety.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

*   **Dependency Injection:** Using dependency injection to manage dependencies improves testability and flexibility.
*   **Configuration Management:** Using configuration files (e.g., TOML, YAML) to store application settings simplifies management and deployment.
*   **Logging:** Using a logging library (e.g., `logging`) for application logging enables easy debugging and monitoring.
*   **Data Validation:** Use a data validation library (e.g., `pydantic`, `marshmallow`) to validate input data and ensure data integrity.
*   **API Clients:** Encapsulate API interactions within dedicated modules, enabling reuse and reducing code duplication. Use libraries like `requests` or `httpx` for HTTP requests. Consider asynchronous clients with `asyncio` for enhanced performance in I/O bound scenarios.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **Global State:** Avoid using global variables excessively. Global state makes code harder to reason about and test.
*   **Magic Numbers:** Avoid using magic numbers in code. Define constants with descriptive names instead.
*   **Duplicated Code:** Avoid code duplication. Extract common code into functions or classes.
*   **Long Functions:** Avoid writing long functions. Break them down into smaller, more manageable functions.
*   **Over-Engineering:** Don't over-engineer solutions. Keep the code simple and focused on the problem at hand.
*   **Ignoring Exceptions:** Never leave `except:` blocks empty. Always handle exceptions appropriately.
*   **Wildcard Imports:** Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`). They pollute the namespace and make it harder to understand where symbols come from.

### 2.4 State Management

*   **Stateless Components:** Prefer stateless components whenever possible. Stateless components are easier to test and reason about.
*   **Immutable Data:** Use immutable data structures (e.g., `namedtuple`, `dataclasses` with `frozen=True`) to avoid accidental state modifications.
*   **Explicit State:** Make state transitions explicit and well-defined. Use a state management library (e.g., `transitions`) for complex state machines.
*   **Centralized State (If Needed):** For complex applications, consider using a centralized state management solution (e.g., Redux-like pattern). However, be mindful of the increased complexity.

### 2.5 Error Handling

*   **Specific Exceptions:** Catch specific exceptions instead of using a broad `except Exception:`.
*   **Logging Errors:** Log error messages with relevant context (e.g., function name, input arguments).
*   **Raising Exceptions:** Raise exceptions when errors occur to signal failures to the caller.
*   **Context Managers:** Use context managers (`with` statement) to ensure proper resource management (e.g., closing files, releasing locks).
*   **Retry Mechanism:**  Implement a retry mechanism for transient errors (e.g., network errors, API rate limits). Use libraries like `tenacity` to easily implement retry logic with customizable backoff strategies.
*   **Error Boundaries:**  Design error boundaries in your application that prevent errors in one part of the system from crashing the entire application.  This can be achieved through exception handling at appropriate levels and the use of circuit breaker patterns.

## 3. Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial for providing a smooth user experience and reducing resource consumption.

### 3.1 Optimization Techniques

*   **Profiling:** Use profiling tools (e.g., `cProfile`, `line_profiler`) to identify performance bottlenecks.
*   **Algorithm Optimization:** Choose efficient algorithms and data structures for critical tasks.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data. Use libraries like `cachetools` or `diskcache` for caching.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Use asynchronous programming (`asyncio`) for I/O-bound operations (e.g., network requests, file I/O). This can significantly improve concurrency and responsiveness.
*   **Multiprocessing:** Use multiprocessing (`multiprocessing`) for CPU-bound operations to take advantage of multiple cores. However, be mindful of the increased complexity of inter-process communication.
*   **Vectorization (NumPy):** Use NumPy for vectorized operations on arrays. Vectorization can significantly speed up numerical computations.
*   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Consider using a JIT compiler (e.g., Numba) for computationally intensive functions. JIT compilation can significantly improve performance.

### 3.2 Memory Management

*   **Garbage Collection:** Understand how Python's garbage collection works. Avoid creating circular references that can prevent garbage collection.
*   **Generators and Iterators:** Use generators and iterators for processing large datasets. Generators and iterators consume memory on demand, avoiding the need to load the entire dataset into memory.
*   **Data Structure Efficiency:** Choose efficient data structures for storing data. Consider using specialized data structures (e.g., `collections.deque`, `heapq`) when appropriate.
*   **Memory Profiling:** Use memory profiling tools (e.g., `memory_profiler`) to identify memory leaks and excessive memory consumption.
*   **Object Reuse:**  Reuse objects when possible to minimize object creation and destruction overhead. This can be particularly relevant for long-running processes.

### 3.3 Bundle Size Optimization (If Applicable)

*   **Tree Shaking:** If using a bundler, enable tree shaking to remove unused code from the bundle.
*   **Code Minification:**  Minify code to reduce the bundle size. Tools like `Terser` can be used for code minification.
*   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images to reduce their size without compromising quality.
*   **Dependency Optimization:**  Analyze dependencies to identify and remove unnecessary dependencies. Tools like `depcheck` can help with dependency optimization.
*   **Compression:**  Use compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, Brotli) to compress the bundle before deployment. This reduces the download size and improves loading time.

### 3.4 Lazy Loading

*   **Module Lazy Loading:** Use dynamic imports to lazy load modules that are not immediately required.
*   **Data Lazy Loading:** Use generators or iterators to lazy load data from databases or files.
*   **Component Lazy Loading:**  Load UI components or application features on demand, improving initial startup time.

*   **Sanitize Inputs:** Sanitize inputs to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
*   **Limit Input Length:** Limit the length of input fields to prevent buffer overflows.
*   **Check Data Types:** Verify that input data is of the expected data type.

### 4.3 Authentication and Authorization

*   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements).
*   **Hashing Passwords:** Hash passwords using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and store them securely.
*   **Salting Passwords:** Salt passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Implement two-factor authentication for increased security.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive resources based on user roles.
*   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** Use JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication and authorization.
*   **OAuth 2.0:**  Use OAuth 2.0 for secure delegation of authorization.

### 4.4 Data Protection
