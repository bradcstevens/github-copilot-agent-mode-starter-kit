- This document outlines the best practices for developing applications using the Sanic framework. Following these guidelines will lead to more maintainable, performant, and secure applications.

## 1. Code Organization and Structure

- **Directory Structure:** Organize your project into logical directories. A recommended structure is:
  
  project_root/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── main.py          # Main application file
  │   ├── routes.py        # Defines application routes
  │   ├── models.py        # Data models (if using an ORM)
  │   ├── views.py         # Request handlers and view logic
  │   ├── config.py        # Application configuration
  │   ├── utils.py         # Utility functions and helpers
  │   ├── middlewares.py   # Sanic middlewares
  │   ├── exceptions.py    # Custom exception definitions
  │   └── services/        # Business logic and service layers
  ├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── conftest.py     # Pytest configuration file
  │   ├── unit/
  │   └── integration/
  ├── migrations/        # Database migration scripts
  ├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
  ├── .env               # Environment variables
  └── README.md          # Project documentation
  

- **File Naming Conventions:**
    - Use descriptive and consistent naming.
    - `routes.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`, `config.py`, etc. are good examples.
    - For service modules, use `service_name_service.py` (e.g., `user_service.py`).
    - Test files should mirror the source file names (e.g., `test_routes.py` for `routes.py`).

- **Module Organization:**
    - Keep modules focused and cohesive.
    - Avoid large, monolithic modules.
    - Group related functionality into separate modules and packages.
    - Use relative imports within the `app` package.

- **Component Architecture:**
    - Adopt a layered architecture (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access).
    - Use dependency injection to decouple components.
    - Employ service objects for complex business logic.

- **Code Splitting:**
    - Defer loading non-critical modules using dynamic imports.
    - Split large route handlers into smaller, manageable functions.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

- **Design Patterns:**
    - **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.
    - **Service Layer:** Encapsulate business logic in service objects.
    - **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic using repositories.
    - **Middleware Pattern:** Use middleware for request pre-processing and response post-processing.

- **Recommended Approaches:**
    - **Configuration:** Use environment variables for configuration and load them with a library like `python-dotenv`.
    - **Database Access:** Utilize an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) for interacting with databases.
    - **Asynchronous Tasks:** Use `asyncio` or a task queue (e.g., Celery) for background tasks.
    - **Response Handling:** Standardize response formats and error handling using custom exception handlers.

- **Anti-patterns:**
    - **Global State:** Avoid using global variables to store application state; use dependency injection instead.
    - **Tight Coupling:** Reduce coupling between components through interfaces and dependency injection.
    - **Long Functions:** Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable units.
    - **Ignoring Exceptions:** Always handle exceptions properly; avoid bare `except` clauses.

- **State Management:**
    - Use application context or dependency injection to manage shared state.
    - Avoid using global variables.
    - Utilize a dedicated state management library (if needed).

- **Error Handling:**
    - Use custom exception classes for specific error conditions.
    - Implement global exception handlers for uncaught exceptions.
    - Log errors with detailed context information.
    - Return informative error messages to the client.

## 3. Performance Considerations

- **Optimization Techniques:**
    - **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to prevent blocking the event loop.
    - **Connection Pooling:** Use connection pooling for database connections to reduce overhead.
    - **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load.
    - **Gzip Compression:** Enable Gzip compression for responses to reduce network bandwidth usage.

- **Memory Management:**
    - Avoid creating unnecessary objects.
    - Use generators for large datasets to reduce memory consumption.
    - Profile your application to identify memory leaks.

- **Rendering Optimization:**
    - Use efficient template engines (e.g., Jinja2) and cache rendered templates.
    - Minimize the amount of data passed to templates.
    - Use response streaming for very large responses.

- **Bundle Size Optimization:**
    - Not directly applicable to Sanic (as it's a backend framework), but if serving static files, minimize and compress them.

- **Lazy Loading:**
    - Defer loading non-critical modules until they are needed.
    - Use lazy imports to improve startup time.

## 4. Security Best Practices

- **Common Vulnerabilities:**
    - **SQL Injection:** Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries or an ORM.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks.
    - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Implement CSRF protection for state-changing requests.
    - **Authentication and Authorization Issues:** Secure your application with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

- **Input Validation:**
    - Validate all user input to prevent injection attacks.
    - Use data validation libraries (e.g., `marshmallow`) to enforce data types and constraints.
    - Escape special characters in user input.

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Use a secure authentication protocol (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT).
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
    - Protect sensitive endpoints with authentication and authorization middleware.

- **Data Protection:**
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
    - Store sensitive data (e.g., passwords) securely using hashing and salting.
    - Use encryption for data at rest.

- **Secure API Communication:**
    - Use HTTPS for all API endpoints.
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    - Validate API requests and responses against a schema.

## 5. Testing Approaches

- **Unit Testing:**
    - Use a testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest`.
    - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., models, services, utilities).
    - Mock external dependencies to isolate components.

- **Integration Testing:**
    - Test the interaction between different components.
    - Use a test database for integration tests.
    - Verify that requests are handled correctly and data is persisted.

- **End-to-End Testing:**
    - Use a tool like `Selenium` or `Playwright` to simulate user interactions.
    - Test the entire application flow from the client to the database.
    - Verify that the application behaves as expected in a production-like environment.

- **Test Organization:**
    - Organize tests into separate directories (e.g., `unit`, `integration`).
    - Use descriptive test names.
    - Follow the arrange-act-assert pattern.

- **Mocking and Stubbing:**
    - Use mocking libraries (e.g., `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`) to isolate components.
    - Create stubs for external dependencies that are difficult to test directly.

## 6. Common Pitfalls and Gotchas

- **Frequent Mistakes:**
    - **Blocking the Event Loop:** Avoid performing long-running or I/O-bound operations in the main event loop.
    - **Incorrect Use of `async` and `await`:** Ensure that all asynchronous operations are properly awaited.
    - **Not Handling Exceptions:** Always handle exceptions properly to prevent application crashes.
    - **Security Vulnerabilities:** Be aware of common security vulnerabilities and take steps to prevent them.

- **Edge Cases:**
    - **Handling Large Requests:** Properly handle large requests to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    - **Graceful Shutdown:** Implement graceful shutdown to avoid data loss.
    - **Concurrency Issues:** Be aware of potential concurrency issues when working with shared resources.

- **Version-Specific Issues:**
    - Consult the Sanic documentation and release notes for version-specific issues and migration guides.

- **Compatibility Concerns:**
    - Ensure that your dependencies are compatible with the version of Sanic you are using.
    - Test your application with different versions of Python to ensure compatibility.

- **Debugging Strategies:**
    - Use the built-in debugger or an IDE with debugging support.
    - Log detailed information about requests and responses.
    - Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks.
    - Check Sanic application and server logs when troubleshooting issues.
