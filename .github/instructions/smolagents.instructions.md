### 1.2 File Naming Conventions

-   Use descriptive and consistent names for files and modules.
-   Agent files: `my_agent.py`, `task_specific_agent.py`
-   Tool files: `web_search_tool.py`, `data_analysis_tool.py`
-   Model files: `llm_model.py`, `embedding_model.py`
-   Configuration files: `config.py`, `api_keys.py`
-   Test files: `test_agents.py`, `test_tools.py`

### 1.3 Module Organization

-   Group related functionalities into modules.
-   Use `__init__.py` files to define packages.
-   Keep modules focused on a specific task or domain.

### 1.4 Component Architecture

-   Design your application with reusable components.
-   Agents, tools, and models should be modular and easily swappable.
-   Use interfaces to define contracts between components.

### 1.5 Code Splitting Strategies

-   Break down large agent implementations into smaller, manageable functions and classes.
-   Consider splitting code based on different stages of the agent's workflow (e.g., planning, execution, evaluation).
-   Use separate modules for reusable logic.

## 2. Common Patterns and Anti-patterns

### 2.1 Design Patterns

-   **Tool Pattern:** Encapsulate external functionalities (e.g., web search, data analysis) into reusable tools. Example: 
    python
    from smolagents import tool

    @tool
    def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> str:
        """Searches Wikipedia for the given query."""
        # Implementation
        pass
    
-   **Chain of Responsibility:** Implement agent workflows as a chain of tasks or sub-agents.
-   **Strategy Pattern:** Allow agents to switch between different strategies (e.g., different reasoning approaches) at runtime.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches

-   **Secure Code Execution:** Use sandboxed environments (e.g., E2B) to execute agent code safely.
-   **Hub Integration:** Leverage the Hugging Face Hub for tool sharing and discovery.
-   **Model Agnosticism:** Design your agents to work with different LLMs.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells

-   **Hardcoding API Keys:**  Store API keys in environment variables or configuration files, not directly in the code.
-   **Ignoring Errors:** Implement proper error handling and logging.
-   **Overly Complex Agents:** Keep agent logic simple and focused.
-   **Lack of Documentation:** Always document your code, especially agent logic.

### 2.4 State Management

-   Use classes to encapsulate agent state.
-   Consider using a state management library for more complex applications.
-   Avoid global state.

### 2.5 Error Handling

-   Use `try-except` blocks to handle exceptions.
-   Log errors with meaningful messages.
-   Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors.
-   Raise custom exceptions for specific error conditions.

## 3. Performance Considerations

### 3.1 Optimization Techniques

-   **Caching:** Cache LLM responses to avoid redundant API calls.
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks.
-   **Efficient Data Structures:** Choose appropriate data structures for your use case.
-   **Prompt Optimization:** Craft prompts carefully to reduce LLM processing time.

### 3.2 Memory Management

-   Be mindful of memory usage when processing large datasets.
-   Use generators to process data in chunks.
-   Delete unnecessary objects to free up memory.

### 3.3 Rendering Optimization (If Applicable)

-   If your agent interacts with a user interface, optimize rendering performance by minimizing DOM updates and using efficient rendering techniques.

### 3.4 Bundle Size Optimization (If Applicable)

## Additional Recommendations

-  **Prompt Engineering:**
    - Be extremely careful about how you craft the prompts being sent to the LLM.  The quality of the prompt directly correlates to the quality of the output. Consider using techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and prompt templates.
-   **Modular Tools:**
    - Design tools to be as reusable and composable as possible. This will allow you to create more complex agent workflows by combining simpler tools.
-   **Cost Tracking:**
    - When using paid LLM APIs, it's important to track the cost of each agent run. This can help you optimize your prompts and agent workflows to reduce costs.
-   **Monitoring:**
    - Monitor your agents in production to identify issues and performance bottlenecks.  Implement logging and alerting to catch errors early.
