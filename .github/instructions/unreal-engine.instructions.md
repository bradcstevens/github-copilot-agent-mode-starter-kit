*   **Strategy:** For defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.
*   **Decorator:** For dynamically adding responsibilities to an object.
*   **Adapter:** For adapting the interface of a class to another interface clients expect.
*   **Object Pool:** Reuse objects to avoid frequent allocation and deallocation, especially useful for projectiles or particle effects.

### 2.2 Recommended Approaches for Common Tasks

*   **Actor Spawning:** Use `GetWorld()->SpawnActor<>()` to spawn actors dynamically.
*   **Input Handling:** Use Enhanced Input System for flexible and configurable input mappings.
*   **Timers:** Use `GetWorldTimerManager()` for timed events and actions.
*   **Collision Handling:** Use collision components and event delegates for collision detection.
*   **Networking:** Use Unreal Engine's built-in networking system for multiplayer games.
*   **Animation:** Leverage Animation Blueprints and State Machines for complex character animations.
*   **UI Design:**  Utilize UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) for creating dynamic user interfaces.

### 2.3 Anti-patterns and Code Smells

*   **Use Data Assets:**  For storing configurable game data (e.g., weapon stats, enemy parameters).
*   **State Tree:** For handling complex AI behavior.
*   **Gameplay Abilities:** For managing player abilities and interactions using the Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

### 2.5 Error Handling

*   **Use `ensure()` for Debug Assertions:** Use `ensure()` to check for conditions that should always be true during development.
