# GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Starter Kit

## Welcome to the "Vibe Code" Experience! ðŸš€

This starter kit is designed specifically for anyone who wants to quickly demonstrate the power of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with Azure integrations. No coding experience requiredâ€”just follow these simple steps to impress your audience with AI-powered development!

## What is "Vibe Coding"?

"Vibe coding" is our way of describing a relaxed, conversation-based approach to creating code and solutions. Instead of writing complex code yourself, you simply *chat* with GitHub Copilot about what you want to build, and it helps you create it!

## Getting Started in 5 Easy Steps

1. **Open VSCode**: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer
2. **Clone This Repo**: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/bradcstevens/github-copilot-agent-mode-starter.git` or download it as a ZIP file
3. **Install Extensions**: Make sure you have the following VSCode extensions installed:
   - GitHub Copilot
   - GitHub Copilot Chat
   - Azure Copilot
   - Azure MCP Server
4. **Sign Into Extensions**: Sign into your GitHub account and Azure account when prompted
5. **Start "Vibe Coding"**: Open the Command Palette (âŒ˜+Shift+P on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows) and select "GitHub Copilot: Start Agent Mode"

## Creating Your First Azure Demo

Once you're in Agent Mode, try prompts like these to get started:

```
"Let's create a simple web app that we can deploy to Azure App Service"

"Help me build a Power BI dashboard that connects to Azure SQL"

"Can you show me how to set up an Azure Function that processes data from Blob Storage?"
```

GitHub Copilot will guide you through the entire process, creating the necessary files, explaining each step, and even helping with the Azure deployment!

## Using the Template Files

This starter kit includes two important template files that will help structure your demos:

- **PLANNING-template.md**: Outlines the overall project plan and architecture
- **TASKS-template.md**: Provides a structured task list to implement the project

Simply reference these templates when starting a new demo by asking Copilot:

```
"Let's use the PLANNING template to structure a solution for [audience need]"

"Can you create a TASKS list based on our PLANNING document for this project?"
```

## Creating Project Plans with Templates

Here's a step-by-step guide to using the templates for your Azure demo:

### Step 1: Start GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette by pressing `âŒ˜+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows)
3. Type "GitHub Copilot: Start Agent Mode" and press Enter
4. Wait for the Agent Mode sidebar to appear

### Step 2: Generate a Project Plan

Once in Agent Mode, ask Copilot to create a project plan using a prompt like:

```
Let's create a simple web app that we can deploy to Azure App Service. Create a plan to deploy the app to my Azure subscription using PLANNING-template.md as your template.
```

GitHub Copilot will:
- Analyze the PLANNING-template.md file
- Create a new PLANNING.md file tailored to your requested scenario
- Fill in all the sections with relevant Azure services and implementation details

### Step 3: Generate the Task List

Once your PLANNING.md is created, ask Copilot to generate a task list:

```
Now that we have a plan, please create a list of tasks that need to be performed from PLANNING.md into a new file TASKS.md using TASKS-template.md as a reference.
```

GitHub Copilot will:
- Review your PLANNING.md file to understand the project
- Analyze the TASKS-template.md structure
- Create a new TASKS.md with specific, actionable steps
- Organize tasks in a logical implementation order

### Step 4: Start Working Through Tasks

With your TASKS.md created, you can begin implementing the project:

1. Focus on one task at a time
2. Ask Copilot to help with each task, such as:
   ```
   Let's work on the first task: setting up our Azure environment. Can you help me with this?
   ```
3. Mark tasks as complete as you finish them by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in TASKS.md

### Example Workflow

Here's an example of a complete conversation with GitHub Copilot:

```
YOU: Let's create a simple web app that we can deploy to Azure App Service. Create a plan to deploy the app to my Azure subscription using PLANNING-template.md as your template.

COPILOT: [Creates PLANNING.md with details about Azure App Service deployment]

YOU: Now that we have a plan, please create a list of tasks that need to be performed from PLANNING.md into a new file TASKS.md using TASKS-template.md as a reference.

COPILOT: [Creates TASKS.md with step-by-step implementation tasks]

YOU: Let's start with the first task. Can you help me set up the basic Node.js application structure?

COPILOT: [Provides guidance and code for setting up the Node.js app]
```

This guided approach ensures that your Azure demo is well-structured and comprehensive, even if you're not a technical expert.

2. **Add instructions** in markdown format, like:
   ```markdown
   - Always use TypeScript for frontend code
   - Prefer functional components in React
   - Follow Azure naming conventions for resources
   ```
3. **Enable the file** by editing the settings:
   ```json
   "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
     { "file": "your-instructions.md" }
   ]
   ```

### Working with MCP Servers

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers extend GitHub Copilot's capabilities:

1. **Azure MCP Server** is pre-configured in this starter kit
2. **Starting the server**:
   - Open Command Palette (`âŒ˜+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows)
   - Search for "MCP: Start Server" and select the Azure MCP Server
3. **Adding more servers**:
   - Edit the "mcp.servers" section in settings.json
   - Add new server configurations following the same pattern

### Testing Your Configuration

After setting up, try a simple Azure command in Copilot Chat:
```
"Can you help me create an Azure Storage account?"
```
If Copilot responds with Azure-specific advice and best practices, your configuration is working!

## Understanding Instruction Files

This starter kit includes several specialized instruction files in the `.github` directory that control GitHub Copilot's behavior and ensure code quality. These files are crucial for maintaining consistency and preventing common issues:

### copilot-instructions.md

This is the primary instruction file that guides GitHub Copilot's behavior when generating code:

- **Prevents Code Sprawl**: Enforces file size limits (max 500 lines) and proper modularization
- **Maintains Consistency**: Ensures consistent naming conventions and import styles
- **Enforces Testing**: Requires test creation for all new features with specific test types
- **Prevents Accidental Deletions**: Instructs Copilot to never delete existing code without explicit permission
- **Requires Documentation**: Enforces commenting standards and documentation updates

**Why It Matters**: Without these instructions, Copilot might generate excessively large files, inconsistent code styles, or code without proper tests, making maintenance difficult.

### core-technologies.md

Defines the specific technology standards for different frameworks used in the project:

- **Establishes Framework Standards**: Sets specific versions and patterns for C#, Blazor, ASP.NET Core, and other technologies
- **Enforces Architecture**: Ensures proper project structure and separation of concerns
- **Maintains Best Practices**: Enforces security standards like JWT authentication and proper error handling

**Why It Matters**: This prevents Copilot from suggesting outdated patterns or mixing incompatible technologies.

### mcp-servers.md

Provides rules for working with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and related infrastructure:

- **Standardizes Deployment**: Establishes consistent deployment pipeline practices
- **Ensures Security**: Enforces secrets management in Azure Key Vault or GitHub Secrets
- **Validates Quality**: Requires build verification and code quality checks

**Why It Matters**: These rules ensure your demo deployments are secure and follow best practices.

### nextjs-instructions.md and self-improve.md

These files provide specialized guidance for specific technologies and continuous improvement:

- **Technology-Specific Guidance**: Ensures Next.js code follows App Router patterns
- **Self-Improvement Process**: Documents how Copilot suggestions are refined over time
- **Prevents Common Mistakes**: Identifies patterns where Copilot might miss context

**Why It Matters**: These specialized instructions help Copilot adapt to the unique needs of your project and improve over time.

### How These Files Work Together

1. **settings.json** enables the instruction files
2. **copilot-instructions.md** provides the core rules
3. **Technology-specific files** add detailed guidance
4. **PLANNING.md and TASKS.md** created from templates provide project context

Together, this system ensures GitHub Copilot acts as a knowledgeable team member who follows your project standards, maintains code quality, and prevents common mistakesâ€”all without requiring you to be a technical expert.

## Azure Best Practices

GitHub Copilot is configured to follow Azure best practices in all generated code:
